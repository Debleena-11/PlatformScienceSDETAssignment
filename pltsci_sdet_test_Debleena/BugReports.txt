Bug#1
Title: 
Cleaning an already cleaned dirt patch results in an increased patch count.
Description:
Scenario Name: "Room5x5_dirtpatch3_clean1_repeat" or "Room5x5_dirtpatch3_clean2"
Steps to reproduce:
use the scenario as specified under "Room5x5_dirtpatch3_clean1_repeat" from RobotTestScenario.json 
Observed result:
while the ending co-ordinates are correctly calculated the patches cleaned are reported as 2 while only one is cleaned twice.
Expected results:
A patch that has already been cleaned shouldn't result in increasing patch cleaned count.

Bug#2
Title: 
Number of patches reported cleaned are higher than total dirt patches placed.
Description:
Scenario Name: "Room5x5_dirtpatch3_clean3" 
Steps to reproduce:
Use the scenario as specified under "Room5x5_dirtpatch3_clean3" from RobotTestScenario.json.
This probably has the same root cause as the bug#1
Observed result:
While the ending co-ordinates are correctly calculated. The total number of patches cleaned cannot be higher that the total number of intial dirt patches placed.
Expected results:
Total number of dirt patches cleaned should always be less than or equal to the initial number of dirt patches placed.

Bug#3
Title:
Negative starting co-ordinates for robot do not yield consistent results.
Description:
Scenario Name: "Negative_coords" and "Negative_coords_sit2"
Steps to reproduce:
Use the scenario as specified under "Negative_coords" or "Negative_coords_sit2" from RobotTestScenario.json.
Observed result:
While the "Negative_coords" scenario results in a error code 400 with empty response, the "Negative_coords_sit2" scenario results in a status 200 response code with bogus response body.
Expected results:
Unacceptable starting co-ordinates  for the robot should always yield in a status response of 400 with an empty body.

Bug# 4
Title:
Dirt patches being reported as cleaned when no patches were installed in scenerio description.
Description:
Scenario Name: "Room5x5_dirtpatch0"
Steps to reproduce:
Use the scenario as specified under "Room5x5_dirtpatch0" from RobotTestScenario.json.
Observed result:
While there were no dirt patches installed in the scenario and movement instruction yields in more than 0 dirt patches being cleaned.
Expected results:
Dirt patches cleaned should be reported as 0, when there are no patches installed.
